# To do app
*todo-app* is a simple nerdy in-shell todo app.

1. Create a dir in your DEV directory (or anywhere) and get the project from GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/jekt/todo-app.git
```

2. Install the package dependancies (if you're on Mac OS, add 'sudo' before the command)
```
npm install
```

3. (Optional) Create an alias to run the command anywhere (change 'path/to/your/dir' to the right path)
```
alias todo="node ~/path/to/your/dir/todo-app/todo"
```

4. Enjoy \o/
You can directly tap the commands using the `--help` param to know more about each of them
```
todo --help
```
Or you can launch the cli
```
todo cli
```
